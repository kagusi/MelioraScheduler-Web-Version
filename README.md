# MelioraScheduler-Web-Version
This is an Independent Project I did during Fall 2015 (Web version).

The main goal of this project is to automate the process by which students schedule appointments with their professors/advisors.

In this project, I build a mobile app(for students use only), a web app(for professors use only) and a RESTFull Service API.
